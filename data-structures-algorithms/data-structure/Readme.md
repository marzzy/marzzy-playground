# Data Structure implementation in javascript

## 1. Linked list

- A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.Instead, each element points to the next.

## 2. Binary search tree

- A binary search tree (BST), also called an `ordered` or `sorted binary tree`, is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.
- The time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional to the height of the tree.

## Run tests

- run `yarn test` to only run tests related to changed files
- run `yarn testAll` to run all test

***Notice :*** on running tests it will also display coverage in terminal + create and update `coverage` folder that contains its html view
